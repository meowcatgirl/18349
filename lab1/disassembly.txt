1. What is the entry point address of the program? (Hint: The readeIf program may provide a clue)

0x82ac

2. What is the name of the first function branched to in the program?

call_gmon_start

3. What is the key difference between the output of objdump -d(hello-d.txt) and objdump -D(hello-bigd.txt)

"-D"- disassembles contents of all sections, not just of those expected
"-d"- disassembles the sections that are expected to contain instructions

4. Is the interpretation of the instructions under the .rodata section of hello-bigd.txt correct? What does this interpretation mean?

Assembly:
 00020001
 6c6c6548
 6f77206f
 21646c72
 00000000

Translation: ????Hello world!????

The intepretation is in little endian representation and provides the same string that we programmed the hello file to print out with extra padding.
